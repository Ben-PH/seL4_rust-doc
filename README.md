# NOT EVEN CLOSE TO SUITABLE AS A REFERENCE


The plan is to be able to read the documentation of this library generated by `cargo doc`, and get a similar insight into the use of the seL4 API and libsel4 as reading the official manual.

You can view it in its current state on the [github pages](https://ben-ph.github.io/seL4_rust-doc/sel4_rust_doc/index.html) site (thanks, vinaychandra)
